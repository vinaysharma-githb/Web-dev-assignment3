📚 Vinay Sharma | Web Development Student Portfolio

Overview

This repository holds the code for my personal portfolio website. I designed it to share my learning progress, showcase my first projects, and detail the foundational skills I've acquired as a web development student.

The portfolio is built using core web technologies and focuses on creating a clean, modern, and fully responsive layout.

🚀 Technologies Used

This project showcases my basic skills in front-end development and responsive design:

Core Languages: HTML5, CSS3

Styling: Custom CSS, focusing on clean design and basic styling techniques.

Layout:

Flexbox: Used for organizing the navigation bar and aligning elements easily.

CSS Grid: Used to create the neat, multi-column layout for the projects section.

Responsiveness: I used media queries to ensure the site looks good on both phones and computers (a mobile-first approach).

Interactivity: I added simple hover effects and CSS transitions to buttons and links for a smoother user experience.
